# TriumphSwiftTest
Are you up for the challenge? 

You are going to help debug and build functionality for our donation app. This will be a simple app that tracks your donations to various charitable organizations with friends. 

# Steps: 

# 1. Setup 

Download the starter project. We .gitignore all Pods files, so be sure to run a "pod install" once cloned. 

The file structure includes a folder of ViewControllers, TableViewCells, Models, and Api. The Api folder pulls json data from firebase and turns them into our model objects. Do not assume these all work as intended ;). 

You can see the structure of our Firebase Real Time Database in database.json. Assume that the data in this json is the exact structure as in the realtime database. You have read, but not write, premissions to this database. You can assume that the database is correctly hooked up to the app. If you are unfamiliar with how to read from the firebase realtime database, use the below as a reference.

2. ViewController. 

You should see a single screen application that does not look fantastic.
